# Predictive_Analytics_for_Airline_Fare_Prices

Project Objective:

This project aims to develop a predictive model to forecast airline fare prices using historical pricing data. By applying advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, the model seeks to provide insights into pricing trends, enabling consumers and businesses to make informed decisions.

Data Description:

The dataset includes historical airline fare data, featuring attributes such as flight dates, departure and arrival times, airline companies, flight durations, and various classes of fares. This comprehensive dataset serves as the foundation for our predictive modeling efforts.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Identifying and handling missing or inconsistent data entries.
Feature Engineering: Extracting and selecting relevant features that influence fare prices, such as time of day, day of the week, and holiday periods.

Model Development:

Utilizing machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forest, XGBoost) to develop a predictive model. The choice of algorithm is based on preliminary analysis and model performance metrics.

Evaluation:

The model is evaluated using standard metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) to assess its accuracy and reliability in predicting fare prices.

Key Findings and Insights:

Summary of the model's performance and its implications for predicting airline fare prices.
Identification of key factors that have a significant impact on fare prices.
Recommendations for consumers and businesses on how to leverage these insights for strategic planning and decision-making.
